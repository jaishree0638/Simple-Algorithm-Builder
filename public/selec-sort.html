                    <li>The process begins with the first element of the array, which is initially considered
                        as the minimum for the current pass.</li>
                    <li>The algorithm then scans through the remaining
                        elements to find the smallest element in the unsorted segment of the array. During this
                        search, each element is compared with the current minimum, and if a smaller element is found,
                        it becomes the new minimum.</li>
                    <li>Once the smallest element in the unsorted portion is identified,
                        it is swapped with the element at the beginning of the unsorted segment. This effectively places
                        the smallest unsorted element into its correct sorted position in the array.</li>
                    <li>After the swap, the boundary of the sorted segment of the array moves one position right,
                        and the process is repeated for the next unsorted portion of the array.</li>
                    <li>This continues, moving
                        from the start of the array to the second element, then the third, and so forth, incrementally
                        reducing the size of the unsorted segment with each pass through the array. The algorithm continues
                        until it has processed all elements except for the last one, which naturally falls into place. The
                        array is now sorted in ascending order. </li>
                </ol>
                Selection sort is known for its simplicity but is generally
                inefficient on large datasets with a time complexity of O(n^2). However, its lack of complexity makes
                it useful for teaching purposes and in scenarios where the data set is small and simplicity is valued
                over efficiency.
